Hi!  
My name is Dominik Waurenschk, and I'm a programmer and video game enthusiast.  
On this blog I plan to write about anything concerning programming, with a focus on game and graphics programming.

You can find my most of my code [here](https://github.com/DasCapschen) and [here](https://gitlab.com/DasCapschen), if I haven't made it private... ðŸ˜œ
