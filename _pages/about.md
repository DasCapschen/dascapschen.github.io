Hi!  
My name is Dominik Waurenschk, and I'm a programmer and video game enthusiast.  
On this blog I plan to write about anything concerning programming, with a focus on game and graphics programming.

You can find my most of my code on [Github](https://github.com/DasCapschen) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/DasCapschen), if I haven't made it private... ðŸ˜œ

If you wonder, fonts are:  
for Text: [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira)  
for Code: [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (for ligatures)  


Source Code for this site can be found [in this github repository](https://github.com/DasCapschen/dascapschen.github.io).  
It uses the Reverie jekyll template found [here](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).
